### Multiple Linear Regression + Assumptions 

By the end of the lesson, the student should be able to:

* [ ] Run a multiple linear regression model using `statsmodels`
* [ ] Explain how to interpret a coefficient in context of multiple regression 
* [ ] Explain how the idea of a hyperplane relates to bi-variate multiple regression  
* [ ] Run a multiple linear regression model using `statsmodels` with multiple continuous variables 
* [ ] Run a multiple linear regression model using `statsmodels` with multiple continuous and categorical variables.
* [ ] Explain what a `dummy coded` variable is in the context of linear regression 
* [ ] Interpret the coefficients, R2, p values, confidence intervals of each predictor variable 
* [ ] Explain what it means for observations to be independent
